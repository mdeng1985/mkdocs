Read on to learn how sponsorship works , and how easy it is to get access to Insiders . A demo is worth a thousand words \u2014 check it out at squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material-insiders How sponsorship works \u00b6 New features first land in Insiders, which means that sponsors will have access immediately . Every feature is tied to a funding goal in monthly subscriptions. When a funding goal is hit, the features that are tied to it are merged back into Material for MkDocs and released for general availability. Bugfixes are always released simultaneously in both editions. 1 Don't want to sponsor? No problem, Material for MkDocs already has tons of features available, so chances are that most of your requirements are already satisfied. See the list of exclusive features to learn which features are currently only available to sponsors. How to become a sponsor \u00b6 You can become a sponsor using your individual or organization's GitHub account. Just visit squidfunk's sponsor profile , pick any tier from $10/month , and complete the checkout. Then, after a few hours, @squidfunk will add you as a collaborator to the super-secret private GitHub repositority containing the Insiders edition, which contains all brand new and exclusive features . Important : If you're sponsoring @squidfunk through a GitHub organization, please send a short email to sponsors@squidfunk.com with the name of your organization and the account that should be added as a collaborator. 2 You can cancel your sponsorship anytime. 3 Join our awesome sponsors If you sponsor publicly, you're automatically added here with a link to your profile and avatar to show your support for Material for MkDocs. Alternatively, if you wish to keep your sponsorship private, you'll be a silent +1. You can select visibility during checkout and change it afterwards. Exclusive features \u00b6 The following features are currently exclusively available to sponsors: Version warning Custom admonition icons Code block annotations Anchor tracking Section index pages Sticky navigation tabs Mermaid.js integration Search suggestions Search highlighting Search sharing Remove generator notice New features are added to this list every few weeks, so be sure to come back from time to time to learn about what's new, or follow @squidfunk on Twitter to stay updated. Funding \u00b6 Goals \u00b6 Following is a list of funding goals.

Is this still possible? Yes. Insiders is compatible with Material for MkDocs. All new features are implemented behind feature flags; all configuration changes are backward-compatible. This means that your users will be able to build the documentation locally with Material for MkDocs and when they push their changes, it can be built with Insiders (e.g. as part of GitHub Actions). Thus, it's recommended to install Insiders only in CI, as you don't want to expose your GH_TOKEN to users. Terms \u00b6 We're using Material for MkDocs to build the developer documentation of a commercial project. Can we use Insiders under the same terms and conditions? Yes. Whether you're an individual or a company, you may use Material for MkDocs Insiders precisely under the same terms as Material for MkDocs, which are given by the MIT license . However, we kindly ask you to respect the following guidelines: Please don't distribute the source code of Insiders. You may freely use it for public, private or commercial projects, fork it, mirror it, do whatever you want with it, but please don't release the source code, as it would counteract the sponsorware strategy. If you cancel your subscription, you're removed as a collaborator and will miss out on future updates of Insiders. However, you may use the latest version that's available to you as long as you like . Just remember that GitHub deletes private forks . You may ask yourself why you should pay for something that is Open Source. Doesn't that contradict the ethos of Open Source software? Yes and no. Yes, some features are locked behind a monthly subscription, which means they are only accessible when paying a small amount of money. No, the features are only exclusive for a short time until specific funding goals are hit. Making an Open Source project sustainable is exceptionally hard: maintainers burn out, projects are abandoned. That's not great and very unpredictable. The sponsorware model ensures that if you decide to use Material for MkDocs, you can be sure that bugs are fixed quickly and new features are added regularly. \u21a9 It's currently not possible to grant access to each member of an organization, as GitHub only allows for adding users. Thus, after sponsoring, please send an email to sponsors@squidfunk.com , stating which account should become a collaborator of the Insiders repository. We're working on a solution which will make access to organizations much simpler. To ensure that access is not tied to a particular individual GitHub account, create a bot account (i.e. a GitHub account that is not tied to a specific individual), and use this account for the sponsoring. After being added to the list of collaborators, the bot account can create a private fork of the private Insiders GitHub repository, and grant access to all members of the organizations. \u21a9 If you cancel your sponsorship, GitHub schedules a cancellation request which will become effective at the end of the billing cycle, which ends at the 22 nd of a month for monthly sponsorships. This means that even though you cancel your sponsorship, you will keep your access to Insiders as long as your cancellation isn't effective. All charges are processed by GitHub through Stripe.

Furthermore, colors can be customized with a few lines of CSS to fit your brand's identity by using CSS variables . Configuration \u00b6 Color palette \u00b6 Color scheme \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Default: default Material for MkDocs supports two color schemes : a light mode, which is just called default , and a dark mode, which is called slate . The color scheme can be set via mkdocs.yml : theme : palette : scheme : default Click on a tile to change the color scheme : default slate var buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button[data-md-color-scheme]\") buttons.forEach(function(button) { button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() { var attr = this.getAttribute(\"data-md-color-scheme\") document.body.setAttribute(\"data-md-color-scheme\", attr) var name = document.querySelector(\"#__code_0 code span:nth-child(7)\") name.textContent = attr }) }) Primary color \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Default: indigo The primary color is used for the header, the sidebar, text links and several other components. In order to change the primary color, set the following value in mkdocs.yml to a valid color name: theme : palette : primary : indigo Click on a tile to change the primary color : red pink purple deep purple indigo blue light blue cyan teal green light green lime yellow amber orange deep orange brown grey blue grey black white var buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button[data-md-color-primary]\") buttons.forEach(function(button) { button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() { var attr = this.getAttribute(\"data-md-color-primary\") document.body.setAttribute(\"data-md-color-primary\", attr) var name = document.querySelector(\"#__code_2 code span:nth-child(7)\") name.textContent = attr.replace(\"-\", \" \") }) }) Accent color \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Default: indigo The accent color is used to denote elements that can be interacted with, e.g. hovered links, buttons and scrollbars. It can be changed in mkdocs.yml by choosing a valid color name: theme : palette : accent : indigo Click on a tile to change the accent color : .md-typeset button[data-md-color-accent] > code { background-color: var(--md-code-bg-color); color: var(--md-accent-fg-color); } red pink purple deep purple indigo blue light blue cyan teal green light green lime yellow amber orange deep orange var buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button[data-md-color-accent]\") buttons.forEach(function(button) { button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() { var attr = this.getAttribute(\"data-md-color-accent\") document.body.setAttribute(\"data-md-color-accent\", attr) var name = document.querySelector(\"#__code_3 code span:nth-child(7)\") name.textContent = attr.replace(\"-\", \" \") }) }) Accessibility \u2013 not all color combinations work well With 2 (color schemes) x 21 (primary colors) x 17 (accent color) = 714 combinations, it's impossible to ensure that all configurations provide a good user experience (e.g. yellow on light background ). Make sure that the color combination of your choosing provides enough contrast and tweak CSS variables where necessary. Color palette toggle \u00b6 It's also possible to add multiple color palettes, including a scheme , primary and accent color each, and let the user choose. A color palette toggle can be added via mkdocs.yml : theme : palette : # Light mode - media : \"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" scheme : default primary : indigo accent : indigo toggle : icon : material/toggle-switch-off-outline name : Switch to dark mode # Dark mode - media : \"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" scheme : slate primary : blue accent : blue toggle : icon : material/toggle-switch name : Switch to light mode In order to set a default theme based on user preference, add a valid media query to the media attribute. This will render a color palette toggle in the header next to the search bar: Light mode Dark mode A demo is worth a thousand words \u2014 check it out at squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material-insiders The toggle field allows to specify an icon and name for each palette. The toggle is rendered next to the search bar and will cycle through all defined color palettes: icon Default: none \u00b7 Required \u2013 This field must point to a valid icon path referencing any icon bundled with the theme , or the build will not succeed. Some popular combinations: + \u2013 material/toggle-switch-off-outline + material/toggle-switch + \u2013 material/weather-sunny + material/weather-night + \u2013 material/eye-outline + material/eye + \u2013 material/lightbulb-outline + material/lightbulb name Default: none \u00b7 Required \u2013 This field is used as the toggle's title attribute and should be set to a discernable name to improve accessibility. Customization \u00b6 Custom colors \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Difficulty: easy Material for MkDocs implements colors using CSS variables (custom properties). If you want to customize the colors beyond the palette (e.g. to use your brand-specific colors), you can add an additional stylesheet and tweak the values of the CSS variables. Let's say you're YouTube , and want to set the primary color to your brand's palette. Just add: : root { --md-primary-fg-color : #EE0F0F ; --md-primary-fg-color--light : #ECB7B7 ; --md-primary-fg-color--dark : #90030C ; } See the file containing the color definitions for a list of all CSS variables. Custom color schemes \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Difficulty: easy Besides overriding specific colors, you can create your own, named color scheme by wrapping the definitions in the [ data-md-color-scheme = \"...\" ] attribute selector , which you can then set via mkdocs.yml as described in the color schemes section: [ data-md-color-scheme = \"youtube\" ] { --md-primary-fg-color : #EE0F0F ; --md-primary-fg-color--light : #ECB7B7 ; --md-primary-fg-color--dark : #90030C ; } Additionally, the slate color scheme defines all of it's colors via hsla color functions and deduces its colors from the --md-hue CSS variable. You can tune the slate theme with: [ data-md-color-scheme = \"slate\" ] { --md-hue : 210 ; /* [0, 360] */ }","title":"Changing the colors"},{"location":"setup/changing-the-colors/#changing-the-colors","text":"As any proper Material Design implementation, Material for MkDocs supports Google's original color palette , which can be easily configured through mkdocs.yml .
